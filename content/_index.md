## A Youth Manifesto for our Digital World.

As the first generation to grow up online, we understand all that the internet can bring: community across continents and cultures, participation in movements that can change the world, instant access to information and services on a scale never dreamed of in history.

So we know our incredible luck – to be born to play, work and dream in this precious place. 

And that’s why we must fight to protect it.

A tiny group of CEOs have taken this gift, this product of collective creativity – and claimed it for themselves. They’ve commandeered its networks; walled in its profits; built vast, opaque monopolies that answer to no one. And in the process, they’ve put our lives at risk. 

- **They are addictive by design**, calibrating their algorithms to suck us in and keep us there; conditioning our minds so we open their apps without fully wanting to; trapping our attention with tightly tailored, toxic feeds that sap our self-esteem along with our time, energy and youth.
- **They are harmful to everyone**, subjecting us to hour after hour, day after day of hate, disinformation, rage and junk, overwhelming the cognitive defences that could deflect each barb alone, but not the full-scale assault, warping our perception of the world around us.
- **They are intrusive**, invading our lives with the biggest surveillance op in history – finding our deepest secrets, sitting in on our private moments, plundering our hopes, our neuroses, our darkest fears. Then exploiting them for cash.

We may be the first generation to live our whole lives as ‘profiles’ to plunder, but **we’re here to say we will be the last**. Because we’ve grown up, and we’re rising up. We’re teachers, activists, lawyers, experts. We’re siblings, colleagues, friends. We’re everywhere and we’ve got plans. 

We’ve got plans for a world where people come first, not corporate profits. Where social media is safe, inclusive and easy to step away from. Where facts and civil debate are promoted above disinformation and clickbait. Where the details of our lives belong to us and us alone.

This is the world all of us want. This is how we make it real. From today, and every day we will be fighting for:

- **Healthy feeds**. Let’s force Big Tech to disclose how they design their algorithms and use our data, so we can swap addiction for enrichment.
- **Choice and diversity**: Let’s take action to break open the Big Tech monopolies so we can build the respectful, safe and empowering social media we really want.
- **Trust and privacy**. Let’s win strong laws to safeguard our personal data and restore our boundaries so when we go online it’s for us and us alone. 

**This is our time: Join the movement. Decide your own future.**
